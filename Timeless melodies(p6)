## 🧩 Challenge Description

> Blaise is excited to share his favourite classical composition with everyone. Join him and find the flag.

**Note:** *THIS IS NOT A NORMAL QUESTION.*  
The flag text which you will ultimately find here consists only of lowercase letters and does **not** contain `EOF{}`.  
If the raw flag you recover is `xyz`, submit it as `EOF{xyz}`.

We were given an audio file:

- The `.wav` file could contain the ciphertext, the key, or additional hints within its audio content or metadata.  
- The text `ybviemjrff` appeared in the challenge context — that’s a good candidate for the ciphertext.

## 🧠 Approach

1. **Extract possible ciphertext or clues**  
   The string `ybviemjrff` appears to be our ciphertext.

2. **Analyze the hints**  
   The line *“For wisdom names where fools mistrust.”* alludes to the quote:  
   *“For fools rush in where angels fear to tread.”*  
   This suggests **the keyword might be `angels`**.

3. **Attempt Vigenère decryption**  
   Try decrypting `ybviemjrff` with candidate keys such as:
